"""
You are given two classes, Person and Student, where Person is the base class and Student is the derived class.
Completed code for Person and a declaration for Student are provided for you in the editor.
Observe that Student inherits all the properties of Person.

Complete the Student class by writing the following:

A Student class constructor, which has 4 parameters:
A string, firstname.
A string, lastname.
An integer, id.
An integer array (or vector) of test scores, scores.
A char calculate() method that calculates a Student object's average and returns the grade character representative of
their calculated average:
